# Magelex

Magelex takes Magento data and presents it in a format that Lexware can read.
The solution is specific for one customers needs.  If you need a similar solution (or have a better one!) contact me!

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install magelex

## Assumptions

## Usage

### Configuration

### Use the command line interface

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bundle console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec magelex` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

Generally, I prefer to work and develop in `bundle exec`-mode.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
